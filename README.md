# WHAT IS THIS

	This is a project by Juan Ignacio Degiovanni (and others) made for
	Software Architecture at Catholic University of Cordoba (UCC)

	The purpose of the project is to build an almost fully functional shopping
	cart from scratch, building both the backend and frontend.

	Languages used:
	  	- BACKEND:
				- GoLang
					- gin-gonic
					- gorm

---

			- FRONTEND:
				- JS:
					- React
				- HTML & CSS
---
			- DB:
				- MySQL
---
	The code is structured following the MVC pattern (Model View Controller)
	The code is made so if you have docker you can just run a Docker Compose and
	everything will work
